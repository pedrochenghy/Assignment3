I was supposed to make some changes here in this last assignment. Nothing new came to the top of my head on my analysis of the Pokemon dataset.
I ran through the comments of Amy on my previous submissions and those I didn't do well was deviations from best practices or under-explanation in write-ups.
So, I figured, why don't I write something about this course.

Not going to lie, I didn't expect much from this course at first - we weren't well-trained in Python or any programming languages like the students from the CST program.
We weren't even experienced in analyzing data. I mean, we barely just learned how to use PowerQuery and Power BI last term. How can we perform to impress?

Fast forward to date as I don't want to over-write too much while I still got a lot of midterms and finals to prepare.
I'm actually grateful for what I learnt from this course. Not only do I know more about GitHub, but I actually got to practice Python more.
I'm more confident to tell people that I know Python (but still, like beginner level).
I remember back when we did the "Automation" assignment. I'm genuinely impressed by my own work.
I could see something that might come in handy in my future work.
That excites me quite a lot.

Thank you.

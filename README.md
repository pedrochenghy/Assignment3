Introduction: Pokémon Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a Pokémon dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using data analytics techniques. The dataset includes attributes such as Type, Attack, Defense, Speed, Total Stats, and Legendary status, allowing for various statistical and visual analyses.

The analysis began with data exploration, where basic summary statistics were generated to understand the dataset’s structure. A data dictionary was created to document each column’s meaning, providing a clear reference for interpretation. Missing values and duplicates were checked and handled appropriately to ensure data integrity.

Next, descriptive analytics were applied through visualizations. A bar chart was used to display the distribution of Pokémon types, highlighting that Water, Normal, and Flying types are the most common. A scatterplot of Attack vs. Defense was created to identify trends, with a regression line added to visualize correlation. The boxplot of Speed for Legendary and Non-Legendary Pokémon revealed that Legendary Pokémon tend to have higher Speed stats, with a more consistent range.

Further analysis examined competitive viability, identifying the top 10 strongest Non-Legendary Pokémon based on Total Stats. Additionally, an investigation into Mega Evolutions determined which Pokémon experienced the greatest increase in stats after Mega Evolution.

This project provided valuable insights into Pokémon attributes using statistical analysis and data visualization techniques. By leveraging structured data, trends that were once based on experience and intuition could now be supported with evidence. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Pokémon game balancing, battle performance, and overall Pokémon design.
